# odin-recipes
A website that provides recipes for delicious food

This website was made for an assignment in the HTML Foundations Course at the amazing [TOP](https://theodinproject.com/).

## Goals
By the completion of this project, I hope to have made a good-looking and well-functioning website with what had been teached so far in the course.
